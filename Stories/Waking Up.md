Chapter 1: Silence

I woke up with a start.
I looked around, my senses taking in my surroundings. Where was I? A underground lab of some sort, it seemed. 
I got out of the capsule which I was in and spun around to take a better look at the place. Bottles spilled, fumes in the air. Vines hung from the cavern above, cobwebs decorating the dusty walls.

Chairs were toppled over, and some buttons were still lit up. A tension hung in the air, despite no figure appearing under my sight. 
I continued pacing around, gazing at the scene before me, gingerly taking each step. 

Just then, my eyes fell upon a note.

A small, crumpled up, yellowed note.

I picked it up, slowly flattening it out, unravelling its secrets. 

"Test subject 1207: Uncontrollable, signs of aggresion." 

I reread the words, puzzled.
But a sudden realization hit me.

My heart skipped a beat.

I turned back and took a closer look at the capsule which I had emerged from.
Across the cracked glass, 4 numbers hastily scribbled on spoke,

"1207".

I am the monster. 

Chapter 2: Daylight

I creeped out of the cavern, the sunlight instantly hitting me as I stood at the entrance. What greeted me was rows and rows and rows of shrubbery, the sounds of wildlife flooding my ears. And in the distance, a volcano stood tall, with smoke pouring out from its blasted-off top. 

I strategically crawled down the slope, my feet attempting to find the rough ridges to grip onto. That, however, was unsuccessful as I slid and tumbled onto the grass below. I yelped upon impact, curling into a ball. 

But then, I realised something. 

I didn't bleed. It did not even hurt the least. 

I gazed up, observing the height at which I had just slid down from. It wasn't short at all. Any normal being would not have survived that fall. 

Am I even human?

I stared down at my feet, which were bare. They looked pretty normal. My eyes moved up to my hands. They looked fine too. What about my face?

I listened for a stream, and the sound of flowing waters led me to a quiet little pond.

I looked into the waters.

Oh my god.

I couldn't find the words to describe how I even looked like. I looked like...A monster. Scars were drawn onto my face, with blood remnants adding a pop of colour.
And a murderous quality.
My face definitely wasn't "normal". There were bumps all over it, stitches hastily sewn on, and most evidently, my right cheek was gone.

Hollowed out. The bones were visible. Like someone or something had bitten into me.

And I was still alive. The blood didn't even flow out. There seemed to be an invisible barrier between my blood and the natural world. 

My fingers searched for the gaping hole, feeling for the bones. But it felt like...normal skin. What exactly am I?

I think I've lost myself.

But I kinda enjoy the new me, too. I am different. I can finally stand out at the very least, that's certain. 

Chapter 3: Discovery

I decide to spend the night in the forest under a great yew tree. I slept pretty peacefully, until I woke to a quiet rumble coming from behind. My eyes opened and I turned back, instantly weary of my surroundings. The rumble escalated into a roar. I looked up.

The volcano.

I took a few steps back from the yew tree as lava started spurting out from the volcano's top. The rage was boiling.

My walk broke into a run.

The lava crashed down on the land beside me as I ducked and swerved through the jungle, my legs starting to give up on me. I may have superhuman qualities, but definitely not superhuman speed. 

Then, a rock tripped me. Yes, a rock. Pathetic, I know, but things happen.

That trip costed me though, for the lava was catching up to me, and I was struggling to get back up. My hands pushed the soil beneath, but I just couldn't lift myself. 

And at that moment I thought, goodbye world, as the lava crept up to my feet.

But the awaited pain was never felt.
