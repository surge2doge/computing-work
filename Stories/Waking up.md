Chapter 1: Silence

I woke up with a start.
I looked around, my senses taking in my surroundings. Where was I? A underground lab of some sort, it seemed. 
I got out of the capsule which I was in and spun around to take a better look at the place. Bottles spilled, fumes in the air. Vines hung from the cavern above, cobwebs decorating the dusty walls.

Chairs were toppled over, and some buttons were still lit up. A tension hung in the air, despite no figure appearing under my sight. 
I continued pacing around, gazing at the scene before me, gingerly taking each step. 

And then, my eyes fell upon a note.

A small, crumpled up, yellow-tinged note.

I picked it up, slowly unraveling its secrets.

"Test subject 1207: Uncontrollable, shows signs of aggresion." 

I read the words, unsure of what it meant.
But a sudden realization hit me.

My heart skipped a beat.

I turned back and took a closer look at the capsule which I had emerged from.
Across the cracked glass, 4 numbers hastily scribbled on spoke,

"1207".

I am the monster. 

Chapter 2: Daylight

I creeped out of the cavern, the sunlight instantly hitting me as I stood at the entrance. What greeted me was rows and rows and rows of shrubbery, the sounds of wildlife flooding my ears. And in the distance, a volcano stood tall, with smoke pouring out from its blasted-off top. 

I strategically crawled down the slope, my feet attempting to find the rough ledges to grip onto. That, however, was unsuccessful as I slid and tumbled onto the grass below. I yelped upon impact, curling into a ball. 

But then, I realised something. 

I didn't bleed. 

I gazed up, observing the height which I had just slid down from. It wasn't short at all. Any normal being would've died from that fall. 

Am I even human?

I stared down at my feet, which were bare. They looked pretty normal. My eyes moved up to my hands. They looked fine too. What about my face?

I listened for a stream, and the sound of flowing waters led me to a quiet little pond.

I looked into the waters.

Oh my god.

What was wrong with me?

Why did I look like that?
